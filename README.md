# ðŸ“Š Financial Risk & Credit Scoring Model

This repository contains my project on **credit risk analytics** â€” combining Python for modeling and Tableau for business visualization.  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Built a **credit scoring model** on 40k+ loan records.  
- Applied **Logistic Regression** and **Gradient Boosting** to predict default risk.  
- Achieved **AUC = 0.88** and **KS = 0.37**, showing strong discriminatory power.  
- Simulated business impact: potential to cut **non-performing loans by 12%** while maintaining approval rates.  

## ðŸ”¹ Repository Contents
- `RiskandCredit.ipynb` â†’ Google Colab notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- Tableau Dashboard (interactive) â†’ [View on Tableau Public]((https://public.tableau.com/authoring/FinancialRiskCreditScoringModel/Dashboard1#1))  

## ðŸ”¹ Dashboard Insights
- **Risk Segmentation**: Customers grouped into Low / Medium / High risk.  
- **Score Distribution**: Histogram of predicted risk scores.  
- **Default Rate by Segment**: Observed defaults across segments.  
- **Calibration Check**: Comparing predicted vs actual default rates.
